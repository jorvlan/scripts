TITLE:      A bivariate first-order vector autoregressive VAR(1) model 
            for two continuous dependent variables
            ! Note: Everything in green behind an exclamation mark 
            ! are comments that Mplus does not read

DATA:	    FILE = VAR_Jane.dat;    ! data file (should be in same folder)

VARIABLE:	NAMES = y1 y2;          ! providing names to the variables 
            USEVARIABLES = y1 y2;   ! select variables for the analysis
	        LAGGED = y1(1) y2 (1);  ! creating first-order
                                    ! lagged observed variables                                    
            MISSING = *;            ! missing value code

ANALYSIS:	ESTIMATOR = BAYES;      ! set estimator (must be Bayes for DSEM) 
	        PROCESSORS = 2;         ! using 2 processors
	        BITERATIONS = (2000);   ! choose number of iterations;
                                    ! minimum is now 2000; will be more if 
                                    ! the convergence criterion indicates
                                    ! convergence was not reached

MODEL:	    y1 ON y1&1 y2&1;        ! specifying the lagged regression for y1
            y2 ON y1&1 y2&1;        ! specifying the lagged regression for y2

OUTPUT:	    TECH1 TECH8;            ! asking additional output

PLOT:	    TYPE = PLOT3;           ! asking for plots
