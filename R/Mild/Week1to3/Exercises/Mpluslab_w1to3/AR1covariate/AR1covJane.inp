TITLE:      A univariate first-order autoregressive AR(1) model 
            for a continuous dependent variable and a covariate
            ! Note: Everything in green behind an exclamation mark 
            ! are comments that Mplus does not read

DATA:       FILE = AR_Jane.dat;     ! data file (should be in same folder)

VARIABLE:   NAMES = y z;            ! providing names to the variables
            USEVARIABLES = y z;     ! selecting the variables for the analysis
            LAGGED = y(1);          ! creating a lagged observed variable
            MISSING = *;            ! specify the missing value code

ANALYSIS:	ESTIMATOR = BAYES;      ! set estimator (must be Bayes for DSEM) 
	        PROCESSORS = 2;         ! using 2 processors
	        BITERATIONS = (2000);   ! choose number of iterations;
                                    ! minimum is now 2000; will be more if 
                                    ! the convergence criterion indicates
                                    ! convergence was not reached

MODEL:      y ON y&1 z;             ! specifying the lagged regression

OUTPUT:     TECH1 TECH8;            ! asking additional output

PLOT:       TYPE = PLOT3;           ! asking for plots
