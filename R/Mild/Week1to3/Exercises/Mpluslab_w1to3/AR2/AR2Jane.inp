TITLE:      A univariate second-order autoregressive AR(2) model 
            for a continuous dependent variable
            ! Note: Everything in green behind an exclamation mark 
            ! are comments that Mplus does not read

DATA:	    FILE = AR_Jane.dat;     ! data file (should be in same folder)

VARIABLE:	NAMES = y z;            ! providing names to the variables 
            USEVARIABLES = y;       ! select variables for the analysis
	        LAGGED = y(2);          ! creating a first- and a second-order
                                    ! lagged observed variable                                    
            MISSING = *;

ANALYSIS:	ESTIMATOR = BAYES;      ! set estimator (must be Bayes for DSEM) 
	        PROCESSORS = 2;         ! using 2 processors
	        BITERATIONS = (2000);   ! choose number of iterations;
                                    ! minimum is now 2000; will be more if 
                                    ! the convergence criterion indicates
                                    ! convergence was not reached

MODEL:	    y ON y&1 y&2;           ! specifying the lagged regression

OUTPUT:	    TECH1 TECH8;            ! asking additional output

PLOT:	    TYPE = PLOT3;           ! asking for plots
