# code (Matlab, R, Python)
This repo contains code that I've created for my a variety of data analyses steps:

(i)pre-processing
(ii) 1st- and 2nd level analyses
(iii) plotting 

Currently, most code is MATLAB based, however, in the near future I might upload new R and / or Python code.

Next up:
I will soon upload MATLAB code that enables import, reformatting, pre-processing and analysis of both Pupil Labs and EyeLink pupillometry.
