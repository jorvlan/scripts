![timecourse example](Python/Pupil%20labs%20pilot%20data.png)

# code (Matlab, R, Python)
This repo contains code that I've created for several data analysis techniques.

Code includes:
(i) pre-processing
(ii) 1st- and 2nd level analyses
(iii) plotting

To be added soon: 
I'm currently working on Python code (Jupyter Notebook) that follows best open science practices for publication ready plotting with the seaborn library.
