# scripts (e.g., Matlab, R, Python)
This repo contains scripts that I've created for my a variety of data analyses steps (e.g., pre-processing, 1st- and 2nd level analyses, plotting etc.) during my master's and beyond. Most of the scripts are MATLAB scripts, however, in the future I might upload R and / or Python code.
