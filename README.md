# code (Matlab, R, Python)
This repo contains code that I've created for several data analysis techniques.

Code includes:
(i) pre-processing
(ii) 1st- and 2nd level analyses
(iii) plotting

I will soon upload MATLAB code that enables import, pre-processing and analysis of both Pupil Labs and EyeLink pupillometry (pupil diameter) data. I'm also working on Python code that follows best open science practices for publication ready plotting.
